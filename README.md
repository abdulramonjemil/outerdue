# Outerbase DUE

This project serves as a reference for working with Outerbase, showcasing a
robust system for defining, using, and referencing commands within a project. A
detailed explanation of the concepts and implementation will be provided in a
future article.

## Why "DUE"?

`DUE` stands for **Define, Use, Export**, which reflects the recommended
workflow when building apps with Outerbase:

- **Define** components within the codebase.
- **Use** these components as part of your project.
- **Export** them for direct use on the Outerbase platform.

This structure promotes clarity, reusability, and a smooth integration with
Outerbase.
